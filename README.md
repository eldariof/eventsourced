Eventsourced
============

Introduction
------------

<i>Eventsourced</i> is a library that adds [event-sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) to [Akka](http://akka.io/) actors. It appends event messages to a journal before they are processed by an actor and recovers actor state by replaying them. Appending event messages to a journal, instead of persisting actor state directly, allows for actor state persistence at very high transaction rates. Persisting changes instead of current state also serves as a foundation to automatically adjust actor state to cope with retroactive changes.

Events produced by an event-sourced actor are sent to destinations via one or more channels. Channels connect an actor to other application parts such as external web services, internal domain services, messaging systems, event archives or other (local or remote) event-sourced actors, to mention only a few examples. During recovery, channels ensure that events produced by an event-sourced actor are not redundantly delivered to destinations. They may also guarantee delivery of produced events by optionally appending them to a journal and removing them once they have been successfully delivered. 

Applications may connect event-sourced actors via channels to arbitrary complex event-sourced actor networks that can be consistently recovered by the library (e.g. after a crash or during normal application start). Channels play an important role during recovery as they ensure that replayed event messages do not wrongly interleave with new event messages created and sent by event-sourced actors. 

Based on these mechanisms, for example, the implementation of reliable, long-running business processes using event-sourced state machines becomes almost trivial. Here, applications may use Akka's [FSM](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0.3/scala/fsm.html) (or just plain actors) to implement state machines where persistence and recovery is provided by the <i>Eventsourced</i> library.

The library itself is an [Akka etxension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0.3/scala/extending-akka.html) and provides [stackable traits](http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/stackable_trait_pattern.html) to add event-sourcing capabilities to actors. All message exchanges performed by the library are asynchronous and non-blocking. Message delivery semantics are <i>at-least-once</i> which essentially requires [idempotent](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2187821) event message receivers. The library provides means to make event message receivers idempotent based on message sequence numbers or sender message ids.

### Application

The library doesn't impose any restriction on the structure and semantics of application-level events. It uses the term <i>event</i> mainly to refer to application state changes. Consequently, applications may therefore use the library for command-sourcing as well. The [Eventsourced reference application](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced-example) even demonstrates how both approaches (i.e. event-sourcing and command-sourcing) can be combined into a single application.

It further demonstrates that the library fits well into applications that implement the [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) pattern and follow a [domain-driven design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/resources/what_is_ddd) (DDD). On the other hand, the library doesn't force applications to do so and allows them to implement event-sourcing (or command-sourcing) without CQRS and/or DDD.

### Journals

For persisting event messages, <i>Eventsourced</i> currently provides the following journal implementations:

- [LeveldbJournal](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.journal.LeveldbJournal$), a [LevelDB](http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/) and [leveldbjni](https://github.com/fusesource/leveldbjni) based journal which is currently recommended for application development and operation. It comes with two different optimizations which are further explained in the [API docs](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.journal.LeveldbJournal$) (see methods `processorStructured` and `sequenceStructured`). It will also be used in the following examples. Because LevelDB is a native library, this journal requires a special project configuration as explained in section [Installation](#installation). 
- [JournalioJournal](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.journal.JournalioJournal$), a [Journal.IO](https://github.com/sbtourist/Journal.IO) based journal. 
- [InmemJournal](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.journal.JournalioJournal$), an in-memory journal for testing purposes.

Further journal implementations are planned, including distributed, highly-available and horizontally scalable journals (based on [Apache BookKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/bookkeeper/) or [Redis](http://redis.io/), for example). Also planned for the near future is a journal plugin API and an event archive.

First steps
-----------

Let's start with a simple example that demonstrates some basic library usage. The event-sourced actor (`OrderProcessor`), used in this example, consumes `OrderSubmitted` events, stores submitted orders in memory and produces ("emits") `OrderAccepted` events to a `Destination` via a channel. This is summarized in the following figure (legend is in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-legend)):

![Order Example 1](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/wip-es-trait/doc/images/order-example-1.png)

Any event message sent to `OrderProcessor` is written to a journal before it is received by the `OrderProcessor`. The state of the `OrderProcessor` can therefore be recovered by *replaying* those messages. During that replay, the `OrderProcessor` is still going to emit `OrderAccepted` events to the channel but the channel will only deliver those events to `Destination` that have not yet been successfully delivered before. The channel is able to distinguish successfully delivered events from others because it logs successful deliveries to the journal.

The following subsections demonstrate two different ways to implement that example, first with a [low-level approach](#low-level-approach) and then with a [higher-level approach](#higher-level-approach) that uses more features from the library. Common to both approaches is the required creation and initialization of the [`EventsourcingExtension`](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.EventsourcingExtension) (an Akka extension).

    import java.io.File
    import akka.actor._

    import org.eligosource.eventsourced.core._
    import org.eligosource.eventsourced.journal.LeveldbJournal

    implicit val system = ActorSystem("example")

    // create a journal
    val journal = LeveldbJournal(new File("target/example"))

    // create an event-sourcing Akka extension
    val extension = EventsourcingExtension(system, journal)
